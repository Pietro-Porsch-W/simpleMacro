# simpleMacro
A simple open source macro, that shall be used in future for a App.

I'm the creator and will be doing a lot of tests for using this in large scale operations.

The idea is firstly doing it in python and later on creating a private and copyrighted version with a front-end cover to be user-friendly, allowing it to be used in a easily.

Use it in your own risk, it's only a test and this shall be used only by who knows what they're doing.

I'm not responsible by anything, i will not create anything besides the working code, how and for what you use is your responsability, because you created the sequencial way to do something you intended.
